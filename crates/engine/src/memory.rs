//! Memory accounting: what each cache holds (`library.memory`, and `ui.inspect` → `memory` with the
//! frontend's own caches added).
//!
//! The numbers are the caches' own bookkeeping (pixels held), not the process's resident size: the
//! allocator keeps freed pages for reuse and the GPU driver maps device buffers, so `ps`/`time -l`
//! report more. A binary built with a heap profiler installs [`set_heap_stats`] (e.g.
//! `lightcraft-cli` with `--features dhat-heap`) to add live/peak heap bytes.
